-Another pylon of night crystal resprite
-Touched up on the paint support for infected mosses.
-Fertilizer now affects the saplings from this mod
-Adjusted code to the new tModLoader changes
-Because of how inconsistent the vanilla wall spreading is, it's very difficult and tedious to create a consistient wall spread system without either breaking the game or messing up another mods take on walls, such an Confection Rebaked. So, I removed the current wall spreading system and replaced it with just grass and stone wall spreading.
-Adjusted biome sight wall highlighting dust colors

-Fixed incorrect dust values for all tiles

-Reverted infected powder changes. They no longer affect walls without tiles.
