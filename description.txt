Quality of life, perhaps you may consider it something different, it really depends on your interpertation.
Focused on the 3 infectious biomes, corruption, crimson, and the hallow. Fixing some issues, some overlooked stuff, and adding new content.
Right now, the mod is in beta, and has not much content. But the content added is at the very least polished.

The main idea of the mod was to fuse the infection biomes with whatever biome they take over. Instead of just cutting you off from probably important stuff, it only makes it harder to get them.

If you have any bugs or suggestions, you can report to me via GitHub: https://github.com/Mellohi138/InfectedQualities

|MAIN FEATURES|
===============	
INFECTED SNOW BLOCKS --> Corrupt, Crimson, and Hallowed snow blocks. 
Normally, snow biome doesn't spread properly on the surface, because snow blocks have no infected variant. This results in the snow biome blocking infections off.
The addition of these blocks fixes this ''issue''. 
Corrupt, crimson, and hallowed snow trees are added as well.

INFECTED JUNGLE BIOMES --> Hallowed jungle grass, and hallowed thorns that only spawn on hallowed jungle grass.
Corrupt and crimson jungles now count as actual jungle biomes. This results in increased spawn rates, and jungle bosses (Such as Plantera and Queen Bee) not getting enraged in the biomes.

INFECTED MOSS BLOCKS --> Moss can now grow on ebonstone, crimstone, and pearlstone. Mostly compatible with resource packs.

INFECTED GEMSTONE BLOCKS --> Gemstone blocks(diamond, ruby, emerald, etc.) can now be infected, mostly for aesthetic purposes.

BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING --> The biome sight potion now highlights all infected walls.

BIOME SPREAD CHANGES --> Infected walls now spread infections.
If Plantera has not yet been defeated, chlorophyte is powerless against stopping infections from spreading, this means the jungle more easily taken over by the infections.
Chlorophyte now prevents hallow from spreading.

DIVINE POWDER --> Acts like a normal powder, spreads hallow. Enabling it makes purification powder purify hallow.

PYLON OF NIGHT --> My own take on the 'corruption pylon' idea. Instead of making seperate pylons for both corruption and crimson, I made a singular pylon that can teleport to both corruption AND crimson. 
Unlike other pylons, this one does not require villagers to function, nor is it sold by them. Instead, it is crafted.

KEY OF NAUGHT --> Crafted with 15 souls of night inside a graveyard, this functions exactly like a normal key of night, except it summons the mimic of the evil biome that wasn't chosen. 
This also disables the normal key of night recipe when inside a graveyard.

INFECTED PLANTERA BULB & LIFE FRUIT --> Pretty self-explanatory, these tiles get their own custom texture when their jungle grass is infected.

INFECTED PLANTERA --> Purely visual, plantera now gets her own custom texture when spawned in an infected biome.

|SMALL CHANGES|
===============
-Corrupt plants now spread corruption.
-Crimson plants now count as crimson biome blocks.
-Infected vines now count towards their respective biome blocks.
-Infected plants, vines, and thorns no longer count towards the Dryad world status calcuations, to fix the precentage being off.
-Infection powders now spread to walls.
-Leather can now be crafted out of 5 vertebrae. In crimson worlds, leather gets shimmered into 5 vertebrae, and in corruption worlds vice versa. They are also now interchangable in a graveyard biome.
-Corrupt jungle grass now emits corruption particles like the other corruption tiles.
-Hallowed grass and hallowed golf grass can now grow crystal shards.
-Corrupt and Crimson ice now grows deathweed instead of shiverthorn.
-Hardmode V-Generation now affects moss blocks and thorns.
-Unused corrupt and crimson lily pads and cattails can now appear.
-Infected grass no longer spreads pre-hardmode, and they no longer spread over each other.
-Light and dark shards are now exchangable with their respective souls inside a graveyard.

|EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES|
=======================
These features are normally disabled, and can be turned on in the config file.

CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE --> After the wall of flesh gets defeated and before the 'ancient spirits of light and dark' get released, the entire world gets purified. 
This results in chasms being cleaned but the infections still remaining in the form of that V-shape. Might help you with biome management.

DISABLING INFECTION SPREADING --> Self explanatory, just enable it in the config and you're good to go. Should not have an effect in Journey mode.

NPCS BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN EVIL BIOMES --> Again, self explanatory. Should save you the annoyance of having to build new houses.

DEMON ALTAR EVIL BLOCK SPAWNING --> Demon altars have a 66% chance to spawn an evil block in the world. This feature used to exist in the main game, before it was removed in 1.4.4
Compatible with other mods, some altars of other mods will spawn in their respective evil tiles, and all altars will spawn in the respective stone of the "good biome"(Hallow, Confection, etc.) into the world.

|MOD COMPABILITY|
=================
The mod was designed with other mods in mind, and manual compability was added when it was needed to. But there might still be incompabilities.
Unless outright stated, all mods in the list should be compatible. This list is just for potential issues that could arise when playing with the mods bellow.

CALAMITY --> Astral infection worldgen doesn't replace infected snows with astral snow, creating a weird overlap. 
Infected jungle fooliage is broken, plants and vines are just gone, so the biomes might end up feeling a bit empty.
Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
You can use Calamity pylons to craft a 'PYLON OF NIGHT'.

CONFECTION REBAKED -->	Conversions between this mods' moss blocks and Confections' moss blocks don't work properly.
Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
'DEMON ALTAR EVIL BLOCK SPAWNING' gives all altars a 33% chance to spawn in creamstone if confection was chosen instead of hallow.

SPIRIT MOD --> Spirit biome doesn't replace infected snow blocks, resulting in an overlap between the spirit biome and whatever biome it generateed over.
Infected moss and gemstone blocks also do not get replaced.
You can use the spirit mod pylons to craft a 'PYLON OF NIGHT'.
Tile spreading added by this mod is compatible with pureglow flowers.

REMNANTS --> Due to the way Remnants generates it's corruption and crimson, the 'CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE' is automatically disabled.
Additionally, Remnants' Hallow generation avoids jungle grass blocks, this means the Hallowed Jungle cannot generate upon defeating the WoF.

EXXO AVALON --> Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
'CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE' also purifies the contagion chasms.
'PYLON OF NIGHT' works in the Contagion.
'DEMON ALTAR EVIL BLOCK SPAWNING' gives icky altars a 33% chance to spawn in chunkstone.

PYLONS PREVENT EVILS --> The game runs, but the features are partially incompatible.
You can make corrupt and crimson snow get purified in the config with no issues, but the hallowed snow gets purified by the hallow pylon.
Hallowed jungle grass cannot be added in the config file.

TERRARIA ORIGINS --> Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
'CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE' also purifies the chasm of Defiled Wastelands and Riven Hive.
'PYLON OF NIGHT' works in the Defiled Wastelands and Riven Hive.
'DEMON ALTAR EVIL BLOCK SPAWNING' gives riven and defiled altars a 33% chance to spawn in riven flesh and defiled stone respectively.

ALTERNATIVES LIBRARY --> The way the mod uses to generate it's hardmode had clashes with this mod. I tried my best to resolve this issue, though expect the hardmode world generation to slow down by a bit. 
Powder and solution interactions are slightly broken, however. Functional, but still a bit broken.
