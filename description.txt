Quality of life, perhaps you may consider it something different, it really depends on your interpertation.
Focused on the 3 infectious biomes, corruption, crimson, and the hallow. Fixing some issues, some overlooked stuff, and adding new content.
Right now, the mod is in beta, and has not much content. But the content added is at the very least polished.

The main idea of the mod was to fuse the infection biomes with whatever biome they take over. Instead of just cutting you off from probably important stuff, it only makes it harder to get them.

If you have any bugs or suggestions, you can report to me via GitHub: https://github.com/Mellohi138/InfectedQualities

|MAIN FEATURES|
===============
INFECTED SNOW BLOCKS --> Natrually, comes with corrupt, crimson, and hallowed variants. 
Normally, snow biome doesn't spread properly on the surface, and a snow biome might actually block off a part of the corruption.
The addition of these blocks fixes this ''issue''.

INFECTED JUNGLE BIOMES --> Comes with hallowed jungle grass, meaning the hallow can now spread into the jungle. Hallowed thorns are added as well, but they only spawn in the Hallowed Jungle.
Corrupt and crimson jungle grass blocks now count as jungle blocks, meaning spawn rates are increased, and plantera doesn't engrage.

INFECTED MOSS BLOCKS --> Moss can now grow on ebonstone, crimsstone, and pearlstone. The stone part of the tiles are supported by resource packs.
Over here at Infected Qualities we highly discourage acts of terrorism against mosses.

BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING --> The biome sight potion now highlights all infected walls. Was designed to be compatible with other mods.

BIOME SPREAD CHANGES --> Infected walls can now spread infections themselves, this is why I made biome sight potions highlight them.
And if the world is pre-plantera, and infected jungle and snow biomes are enabled, chlorophyte is powerless against stopping infections from spreading. Additionally, chlorophyte now prevents hallow from spreading as well.

DIVINE POWDER --> Acts like a normal powder, spreads hallow. Also purification powder now purifies hallow.

PYLON OF NIGHT --> My own take on the 'corruption pylon' idea. Instead of making seperate pylons for both corruption and crimson, I made a singular pylon that can teleport to both corruption AND crimson. 
Unlike other pylons, this one does not require villagers to function, nor is it sold by them. Instead, it is crafted.

KEY OF NAUGHT --> Crafted with 15 souls of night inside a graveyard, this functions exactly like a normal key of night, except it summons the mimic of the evil biome that wasn't chosen. 
This also disables the normal key of night recipe when inside a graveyard.

INFECTED PLANTERA BULB & LIFE FRUIT --> Pretty self-explanatory, these tiles get their own custom texture when their jungle grass is infected.

INFECTED PLANTERA --> Purely visual, plantera now gets her own custom textures when spawned in an infected biome. If you are in an infected jungle biome, plantera should not enrage.

|SMALL CHANGES|
===============
-Corrupt plants now spread corruption.
-Crimson plants now count as crimson biome blocks.
-Infected vines now count towards their respective biome blocks.
-Infected plants, vines, and thorns no longer count towards the Dryad world status calcuations, to fix the precentage being off.
-Infection powders now spread to walls.
-Leather can now be crafted out of 5 vertebrae. In crimson world, leather gets shimmered into 5 vertebrae, and in corruption worlds vice versa. Also, they are now interchangable in a graveyard biome.
-Corrupt jungle grass now emits corruption particles like the other corruption tiles.
-Hallowed grass and hallowed golf grass can now grow crystal shards.
-Corrupt and Crimson ice now grows deathweed instead of shiverthorn.
-Hardmode V-Generation now affects moss blocks and thorns.
-Unused corrupt and crimson lily pads and cattails can now appear.

|EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES|
=======================
These features are normally disabled, and can be turned on in the config file.

CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE --> After the wall of flesh gets defeated and before the 'ancient spirits of light and dark' get released, the entire world gets purified. 
This results in chasms being cleaned but the infections still remaining in the form of that V-shape. Might help you with biome management.

DISABLING INFECTION SPREADING --> Self explanatory, just enable it in the config and you're good to go.

NPCS BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN EVIL BIOMES --> Again, self explanatory. Should save you the annoyance of having to build new houses.

DEMON ALTAR EVIL BLOCK SPAWNING --> Demon altars have a 66% chance to spawn an evil block in the world. This feature used to exist in the main game, before it was removed in 1.4.4

|MOD COMPABILITY|
=================
The mod was designed with other mods in mind, and manual compability was added when it was needed to. But there might still be incompabilities.

CALAMITY --> Astral infection does not convert infected snow blocks. Astral worldgen only looks for the normal snow block to convert instead of just using the snow block list.
Additionally, Calamity's system for handling the conversion between normal plants and astral plants messes up the way infected plants and vines work in the jungle, as a result they are just gone.
Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
You can use Calamity pylons to craft a 'PYLON OF NIGHT'.

CONFECTION REBAKED -->	Added solution interactions for 'INFECTED MOSS BLOCKS'.
Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.

SPIRIT MOD --> You can use the spirit mod pylons to craft a 'PYLON OF NIGHT'.

REMNANTS --> Due to the way Remnants generates it's corruption and crimson, the 'CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE' is automatically disabled.
Additionally, Remnants' Hallow generation avoids jungle grass blocks, this means the Hallowed Jungle cannot generate upon defeating the WoF.

EXXO AVALON --> Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
'CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE' also purifies the contagion chasms.
'PYLON OF NIGHT' works in the Contagion.

PYLONS PREVENT EVILS --> The game runs, but the features are partially incompatible.
You can make corrupt and crimson snow get purified in the config with no issues, but the hallowed snow gets purified by the hallow pylon.
Hallowed jungle grass cannot be added in the config file.

TERRARIA ORIGINS --> Manual compability with the 'BIOME SIGHT WALL HIGHLIGHTING' was added.
'CHASM PURIFICATION UPON HARDMODE' also purifies the chasm of Defiled Wastelands and Riven Hive.
'PYLON OF NIGHT' works in the Defiled Wastelands and Riven Hive.

ALTERNATIVES LIBRARY --> The way the mod uses to generate it's hardmode had clashes with this mod. I tried my best to resolve this issue, though expect the hardmode world generation to slow down by a bit.
