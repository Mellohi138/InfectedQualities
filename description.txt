Quality of life, perhaps you may consider it something different, it really depends on your interpertation.
Focused on the 3 infectious biomes, corruption, crimson, and the hallow. Fixing some issues, some overlooked stuff, and adding new content.
Right now, the mod is in beta, and has not much content. But the content added is at the very least polished.
The main idea of the mod was to fuse the infection biomes with whatever biome they take over. Instead of just cutting you off from probably important stuff, it only makes it harder to get them.
